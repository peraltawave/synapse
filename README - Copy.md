## About this Project

The front end allows us to view the current information inside our database. It also allows us to add new data into it, delete a present data and update an already existing one. (CRUD)
We will use **create-react-app** to bootstrap our front end, which means that we will not have to worry about setting up Webpack or Babel (as create-react-app sorts this all out by default).

## Stuff we are trying, experimenting with, etc
- ### **react-table** // Fully customizable (JSX, templates, state, styles, callbacks)
	> https://react-table.js.org/#/story/simple-table

- ### **Browsersync** // Time-saving synchronised browser testing.
	> https://www.browsersync.io/

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

# Yarn
$ yarn add react-table
```


## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
